# 🚗 Toyota Auto-Budget (JourneyFi)

**Your Road to Smarter Car Ownership.**

Toyota Auto-Budget — also known as **JourneyFi** — is a full-stack React web application that helps users visualize, customize, and plan their vehicle financing journey.  
It calculates personalized loan or lease payments, visualizes total costs, and even displays an interactive 3D Toyota RAV4 model — all in one intuitive interface.

## 🌟 Inspiration

Car shopping can be confusing and intimidating — especially when comparing financing, leasing, rebates, and trade-in options.  
We wanted to build a transparent, visual, and educational experience that empowers drivers to understand **what they can actually afford** before walking into a dealership.

  Users move through stages — Vehicle Info → Financial Info → Payment Preferences → Results.

- **Interactive 3D Toyota Display:**  
  View a 3D Toyota RAV4 model using Three.js and OrbitControls.

- **Real-Time Payment Calculator:**  
  Loan/lease payments, interest, and total cost update dynamically based on user inputs.

- **Smart Rebates & Trade-In Integration:**  
  Users can toggle Military or College rebates, add trade-ins, and instantly see updated totals.

- **Toyota Matchmaker Quiz:**  
  A lightweight “personality quiz” that helps users discover which Toyota model best fits their lifestyle.
